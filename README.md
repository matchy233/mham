# Mobile Health and Activity Monitoring

## Things to notice for collaboration

* Mind your commit message format
  * This repo adopts the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format
  * The commit message should be meaningful and informative (describing what you have done)
* The `master` branch is **protected**, you **should not** (and **cannot**) push to it directly
  * ALWAYS create a new branch for your work
  * Make a pull request to merge your branch to `master`
  * You need at least one approval from your teammates to merge your branch to `master`
  * After merging, delete your branch

## Working on Kaggle

The following docs from Kaggle are useful. Note that Kaggle can only import
*a certain file* instead of the whole repo from GitHub.

* [Import GitHub code from GitHub to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/221448)
* [Save Notebooks (and commit directly) from Kaggle to GitHub](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/295170)

Before you import the notebooks from GitHub, always bear in mind that
**the `master` branch is protected**. You cannot push to it directly. Thus,
to save and sync your work on Kaggle to GitHub, it is recommended to create a
 new branch first and make edits on that branch.
