# Mobile Health and Activity Monitoring

## Directory structure

The most important subdirectory is `src`: it contains the template code provided
by the TA and should be your **workspace**. Import that directory to Kaggle to
 start working.

## Things to notice for collaboration

* Mind your commit message format
  * This repo adopts the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format
  * The commit message should be meaningful and informative (describing what you have done)
* The `master` branch is **protected**, you **should not** (and **cannot**) push to it directly
  * ALWAYS create a new branch for your work
  * Make a pull request to merge your branch to `master`
  * You need at least one approval from your teammates to merge your branch to `master`
  * After merging, delete your branch
