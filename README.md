## Directory structures

The most important subdirectory is `src`: it contains the template code provided 
by the TA and should be your **workspace**. Import that directory to Kaggle to
 start working.

Contents of other subdirectories:

- `exercises`: contains exercise instructions, and reports
- `lectures`: contains lecture slides
- `read-assn`: contains reading assignment

They just exist so that you do not need to tediously use id and pw to access
 the course contents.
